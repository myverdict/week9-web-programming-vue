    <p>If you see the below error in dev tools,</p>

    <img
      src="./images/1.png"
      data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true"
      style="max-width: 100%"
      width="500px"
    />

    <p>
      and a warning as below in the cli after running
      <strong>npm run dev</strong>,
    </p>

    <p>
      <img
        src="./images/2.png"
        data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true"
        style="max-width: 100%"
        width="500px"
      />
    </p>

    <p>
      then check your code for phantom lines, example, the one on line 2 as
      shown below;
    </p>

    <p>delete line 2 to fix the error.</p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="./images/3.png"
        data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true"
        style="max-width: 100%"
      />
    </p>

    What happened?
    <p>
      If you are typing code and you use a variable called 'response' without
      defining it, (or your definition has a typo) then VSCode will assume that
      you mean a variable called 'response' in the Express framework and
      helpfully add that import.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, that is not what you want to do - the correct fix is to
      define your response variable or correct your spelling.
